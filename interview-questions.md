# ASSESSMENT 1: Tech Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions. First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory. Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely on your own, there is always something more to learn.   

1. What is a function? Why would you use one?

  Your answer:
A function is like a machine - it takes in a piece of code or an input and manipulates it to create a different output. This is so we don't have to repeat ourselves in our code - if the same change needs to happen to multiple inputs, they can all go through a single function.  

  Researched answer:

A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
-- The input for the function is called a PARAMETER and is found inside the parentheses () 
-- When a function is called (invoked), the variables inside the parenthases are called ARGUMENTS
Why Functions?
You can reuse code: Define the code once, and use it many times.

You can use the same code many times with different arguments, to produce different results.


2. What is the difference between map and filter?

  Your answer: .map performs the function on all items in an array and returns an array with the same number of variables, .filter keeps/removes variables bases on set parameters

3. What is the difference between console.log() and return?

  Your answer:
  console.log() prints to the terminal what the code is doing, whereas return is what ends the function and tells it what the finished product is

  Researched answer:
// from codecademy.com 
console.log() is a function used to print information to the console. return on the other hand is a call to pass some value back up to where the call was made. 


4. In regards to functions, what is an argument?

  Your answer:
  An argument is a required input that the function is performing upon.

  Researched answer:
  //from W3Schools.com
  Function arguments are the real values passed to (and received by) the function.




5. Give a brief description of proper pair programming techniques. What are the roles of each person?

  Your answer:
In pair programming, one person is the driver, and the other is the navigator. The driver is the one typing the code, while the navigator is providing perspective on the logic, the project scope, and the next steps for the driver. The roles are switched to give both people turns driving and navigating. Together the pair is able to work together to achieve the objective.

  Researched answer:
// from wikipedia
Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.

6. What is TDD? Describe the work flow associated with TDD.

  Your answer:
TDD is test driven development. It is where testing code and writing code are done simultaneously to check for bugs or errors in the code. This can help in the future if code is changed or added to by showing where bugs pop up or breaks in the code happen.
  Researched answer:
//from wikipedia
Test-driven development (TDD) is a software development process that relies on the repetition of a very short development cycle: requirements are turned into very specific test cases, then the code is improved so that the tests pass.


7. What is something we did in class this week you found helpful?  

  Your answer:
I really enjoyed the lectures and working through practice problems together. I appreciate the floor being open for questions to make sure we're understanding things well. I think it might be helpful to show a 'working' piece of code that implements what it is we're going to be learning so we have a bit more context before we simplify down. 


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

- React - React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications.
- Yarn - Yarn is a package manager that doubles down as project manager.
- React State - In the React sense, “state” is an object that represents the parts of the app that can change. Each component can maintain its own state, which lives in an object called this
- CRUD - Create, Read, Update, and Delete (CRUD) are the four basic functions that models should be able to do, at most. four basic functions of persistent storage.
- this - The JavaScript 'this' keyword refers to the object it belongs to. In a method, 'this' refers to the owner object. Alone, 'this' refers to the global object. In a function, 'this' refers to the global object.
